          <p></p>
          I am a civil engineer, data analyst, web developer, and in-progress statistician with
          five years of professional experience in the transporation industry. I developed these 
          apps to help automate some of the onerous and prohibitive leg work of wrangling datasets 
          into formats that can be easily analyzed, as well as automating some of the anlaysis work. 
          The apps deal with a wide range of datasets from Census data to vehicular traffic volumes to 
          facebook comments. 
          I hope you enjoy using the apps as much as I do and that you 
          are able to do much more exciting and value-adding work with the greater data access these 
          applications provide.
          <p></p>
          Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement to the apps. If 
          you find any or all particularly useful, I'd love to hear from you. Enjoy!
